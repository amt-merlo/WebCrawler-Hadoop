aber teilweis massiv umgebauten rasentraktoren oder genannten aufsitzmähern \u201Elawn mower racing\u201C bezeichnetbeim rasenmäherrennen geht es wie bei allen motorsportrennen darum sein gefährt schnellstmöglich über ein dafür vorgesehen rennstreck zu bewegen ohn die konkurrenten zu rammen oder zu behindern derartig veranstaltungen erreichen teilweis besucherzahlen von über 30000 besuchern zum beispiel thönse geprägt sind die veranstaltungen von einem volksfestähnlichen rahmenprogramm rund um da eigentlich rennen der untergrund für die rennstrecken besteht der regel au acker oder weid auf denen mit geschwindigkeiten bi zu 80 km\/h gefahren wirddi meisten rennen werden anhand von mehreren kurzen läufen 15\u201330 minuten durchgeführt bei denen je nach platzierung punkt vergeben werden je nach teilnehmerzahl wird dann auf grund der punkt end der sieger festgestellt oder es gibt noch einen final-lauf mit den punktstärksten teilnehmern die verschiedenen startklassen wechseln sich hier ab dass all team zeit für ein paus oder dringend wartungsarbeiten haben es gibt aber auch rennen bei welchen die teilnehm einer vorgegebenen zeit bi zu zwei stunden möglichst viel runden fahren müssenein intern abgestimmt reglement gibt es nichtinnerhalb deutschland existiert kein nation abgestimmt reglement dort legen die einzelnen veranstalt die regeln selbst fest wobei dies sich insgesamt immer mehr annähern dennoch sind immer die regeln vor ort zu beachten es existieren aber auch bemühungen ein möglichst große zahl veranstaltungen mit identischem regelwerk durchzuführenmittlerweil entscheiden sich immer mehr veranstalt da einheitlich regelwerk erw al grundlag für ihr rennen zu nehmen dies kommt den team und fahrern zugut die dadurch planungssicherheit beim bau der renntreck haben und schon lang vorher wissen können ob sie mit ihrem renntreck bei einem rennen teilnehmen können bzw dürfene gibt aktuel zwei teil massiv unterschiedlich regelwerk die den größten teil der etablierten rennveranstaltungen abdeckenim groben kern findet man aber beiden varianten gemeinsamkeiten die es den erbauern der renntreck ermöglichen mit ein und demselben renngefährt allen rennveranstaltungen teilzunehmenseit einig zeit wird immer mehr auf die sicherheit der fahrer geachtet sind mittlerweil geprüft helm brustpanz sowi fest schuhwerk und handschuh etc bei allen ernsthaften rennen vorgeschrieben über die diversen regelwerk hinau wird bei der technischen abnahm durch den veranstalt auch darauf geachtet dass kein scharfen kanten hervor stehen oder sonstig gefährdungen vom jeweiligen renntreck ausgehen schon fast seit anbeginn dürfen kein mähwerk mehr verbaut sein bremsen werden auf ihr einwandfrei funktion geprüft ein not-aus-schalt muss dafür sorgen dass der motor ausgeht wenn ein fahrer seinen renntreck unfreiwillig verlässt auf der rennstreck gibt es immer streckenposten warnwesten die ggf durch flaggen anzeigen ob es auf der streck problem gibt die veranstalt schließen versicherungen ab und sorgen dafür dass medizinisch hilf johanniter-unfall-hilf etc vor ort sinddi zuschauer werden nicht nur durch strohballen sondern auch durch reifen fangzäun für von der bahn abkommend mäher oder sicherheitszonen von der streck getrenntrasenmähertreckerrennen sind ein über die einzelnen veranstaltungen hinau oft unorganisiert amateursport dementsprechend hat der begriff weltmeisterschaft keinen geschützten charakt die zahlreichen entsprechend titulierten veranstaltungen aufzeigen es existiert aber nun schon ein seit 2008 geführt tabel welch die ergebniss von einzelnen veranstaltungen ein gesamtlist einrechnet und einen fast bundesweiten überblick liefert welch fahrer bzw team leistungsmäßig wo stehen 2011 wurden hier erstmal die inoffiziellen deutschen meister der jeweiligen klassen im rasentreckerrennen ausgefahrendi beiden feststellungen \u201Ewe need cheap motor sport\u201C und \u201Eeverybodi lawn mower\u201C sollen 1973 im lokal cricket arm wisborough green den beginn der rasenmäherrennen ausgelöst haben noch im selben jahr wurd die british lawn mower race associ blmra gegründet 1982 folgt die gründung der north west lawn mower race associ nwlmra 1992 die gründung der us lawn mower race associ uslmraauch belgien den niederlanden luxemburg und der schweiz existieren größere renntreckerverbändein deutschland verbreitet sich die randsportart seit 1993 es existieren mittlerweil einig regelmäßig veranstaltungen deutschland u ada bisher größte rasenmähertreckerrennen deutschland fand 2007 mit über 30000 besuchern und über 80 startenden team thönse statt im august 2013 lief da zwölfte und laut veranstalt letzt rennen dieser art thönseda wahrscheinlich erst rasenmäherrennen deutschland fand haschenbrok statt[1]di meistgestellt frage von zuschauern die rennteam lautet \"und wie schnell fährt der so\" fachlich korrekt antwort die meisten rennrasenmäh erreichen kaum mehr al 50 km\/h wa oft völlig ausreicht aber professionel gebaut rennmaschinen mit einem guten fahrer erreichen unter idealen bedingungen durchau 80 km\/h und mehrdi fahrer mit den meisten punkten der gesamtlist der \u201Eerwm\u201C einheitlich regelwerksmeisterschaft[2] warenin 2010 gab es au diversen gründen kein meisterschaftslistetraditionel werden mäher verwendet die ihren motor vorn unter einer haub sitzen haben und dessen chassi au formblechteilen besteht es gibt aber durchau auch varianten mit mittelmotor etc waren es der anfangszeit noch fast unmodifiziert originalgefährt sind es mittlerweil bei vielen teilnehmern die diesen sport ernsthaft betreiben doch recht speziel umbauten die meist nur noch durch form und größe rasenmäh erinnern besond gern gesehen werden aber gut gebaut rennmäher die offensichtlich noch nahe origin sind beim bau ein solchen rennboliden wird teilweis sehr viel zeit materi und kreativität investiertum die vergleichbarkeit zu gewährleisten wurden verschieden klassen gebildet die sich meist antriebsart und motorisierung unterscheidenin deutschland hatten sich bi end der saison 2016 überwiegend folgend klassen durchgesetztab 2017 steht der austragung der deutschen meisterschaft der erw ein weiter neue klasse[3] zur verfügungda die wahr leistung der verwendeten motoren nur schwer überprüfbar ist wird sie al nennleistung de originalen motor definiert die durch maßnahmen erhöht werden kann es muss aber jedem fall ein motor verwendet werden wie er für rasenmäh oder al industriemotor üblich ist also z b kein motorradmotoren der antrieb muss immer über einen keilriemen realisiert werden im antriebsstrang dürfen aber auch weiter antriebsmittel verwendet werden ketten zahnriemen etcdarüb hinau existieren veranstaltungen die vom allgemeinen erwm- oder

80 máy cắt cỏ đã xuất hiện cho cuộc gặp gỡ đầu tiên đó[2]hiện tại một số câu lạc bộ đua máy cắt cỏ ở anh có các qui tắc xây dựng hơi khác nhau nhưng luôn giữ một đặc điểm tương đồng là các sự kiện được điều hành chuyên nghiệp và chi phí được giữ ở mức tối thiểu đua xe có xu hướng diễn ra tại các khu đất trống với đường đua được đánh dấu theo kiểu tạm thời thường sử dụng kiện hoặc khối nhựa các
